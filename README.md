This work extends upon the Antarctic fracture detection methods put forth by Lai, et.al [11]. Their paper aims to utilize deep learning techniques to semantically segment satellite images of Antarctica, thus identifying ice shelf fractures which inevitably contribute to Antarctic ice mass loss. We have evaluated the performance of the SegNet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+ architectures against the U-Net proposed in the original work. It was found that the PSPNet and DeepLabV3+ were able to leverage multiscale information to surpass the U-Net's performance. The SegNet’s transfer of pooling indices limited the model’s ability to properly decode the data, thus decreasing performance when evaluated against the U-Net. The results of this work have a direct impact on our capacity to monitor Antarctic ice conditions and forecast ice mass loss. Furthermore, the methods can be extended to generate fracture predictions in other locations where ice mass loss is a concern, such as Greenland.
